TODO MVP:

Http Server Implementation:
- Better support for HTTP requests and responses headers (check the ugly getHeader, getHeaders and getBody methods from response/request);
- Implement access control for files and directories (.htaccess or similar);
- Add HTTP Client for usage within sidecar project;

Build Process
- Clean up and separate in log files the build process, being verbose only when the build crashes;
- Try to unify docker.ps1 and docker.sh since the .sh version is currently outdated;
