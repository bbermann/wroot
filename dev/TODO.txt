TODO MVP:

Http Server Implementation:
- Better support for HTTP requests and responses headers;
- Implement access control for files and directories (.htaccess or similar);

Build Process
- Clean up and separate in log files the build process, being verbose only when the build crashes;
- Try to unify docker.ps1 and docker.sh since the .sh version is currently outdated;
