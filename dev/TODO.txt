TODO MVP:

Http Server Implementation:
- Better support for HTTP requests and responses headers;
- Implement access control for files and directories (.htaccess or similar);
- Add HTTP Client for usage within sidecar project;
- In order to allow the HTTP Client implementation:
    1.1 Request::fromString
        - Replace the boost::asio char by char method for something better if possible (there's a good example
            in the incomplete implementation of HttpClient)
        - Move the implementation to the Request class (static method)
    1.2 Request::toString
    2.1 Response::fromString
    2.2 Response::toString

Build Process
- Clean up and separate in log files the build process, being verbose only when the build crashes;
- Try to unify docker.ps1 and docker.sh since the .sh version is currently outdated;
