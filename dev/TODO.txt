TODO MVP:

Http Server Implementation:
- Better support for HTTP requests and responses headers;
- Implement access control for files and directories (.htaccess or similar);
- Support response http major/minor version pairing with request's version
- Check why Chrome doesn't accept our responses as valid.

- Try to unify docker.ps1 and docker.sh since the .sh version is currently outdated;

RouterLibrary
- Fix it
- Verificar pq LuaScriptException não exibe texto no what().
